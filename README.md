I developed a dynamic modelling portfolio website from scratch and it comes with some features I'm sure many people would appreciate.

My Favourite Features:

- Dark-mode bar for those who prefer dark mode or often get migraines.

- One-page dynamic website that allows smooth scrolling between website sections which are linked in the side navigation bar.

- 'Scroll to top' button lets users quickly scroll to the top of the page with a single click no matter what position they are currently at.

- A contact form has been added to the website to enable users to send emails directly from the site. To enable form submissions, I hosted and deployed the website on Netlify, a cloud-based platform.
